// Step 1: Save the like button element in a variable
let likeBtn = document.getElementById('like-btn')

// Step 2: Create function to add likes. This function makes it so that the "0" goes up when you press the button. We'll talk more about functions in a later class! 
const addLike = () => {
  const likeCount = document.getElementById('like-count');
  let currentCount = parseInt(likeCount.textContent);
  likeCount.textContent = currentCount + 1;
}

// Step 3: Create an event listener that increases the likes when the user presses the like button 
likeBtn.addEventListener('click', addLike)

// Step 4 (If time): Can you make it so that the number of likes increases when the user double taps the image? Hint: you will have to use a different kind of event! 
  //1: Save the image in a variable 
  //2: Add an event listener (addEventListener)
